	<p>In this project, created as an interview challenge for Comma.ai, I was tasked with creating a machine learning algorithm that was given a dashcam video where every frame was labelled with the speed of the car at that moment, and to predict tthe speed of a car in another similar video.</p>
	<p>This project taught me a ton about how to effectively manipulate data, especially when the correct use for that data is not immediately clear. I ended up using optical flow to get some meaningful data from the video. That ended up being a very productive rabbit hole in itself, and taught me how to pick up skills on the fly and implement them into a project. I also learned a lot about creating machine learning algorithms using PyTorch. This was the first project for which I used machine learning in a non-trivial capacity.</p>
